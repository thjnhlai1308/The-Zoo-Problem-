        <!--Paragraph describing Batman -->
        <p> 
            Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a 
            child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal 
            of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and 
            Batman Incorporated.

        <!--Paragraph desribing The Flash-->
        <p> 
            The mysterious power known as the Speed Force is an energy field that has, over the centuries, granted incredible powers of velocity to certain heroes. 
            The most famous of these is the Flash, also known as the Fastest Man Alive. Ever since the days of World War II, there has been a man clad in red 
            who can run at impossible speeds, using his power to save lives and defend those who cannot defend themselves. All between the ticks of a second.

            Part man, part machine, Victor Stone is a former member of the Teen Titans and a current member of the Justice League who wrestles to preserve his humanity with 
            every new upgrade. Although he always exhibited a genius level intellect, young Victor Stone didn’t want a life dedicated to science and research like his 
            parents. Instead, Vic dreamed of being a football player, and devoted all of his time to becoming a star athlete while he was still in high school. But a 
            tragic twist of fate that should have left him dead instead found him becoming part man and part machine—a Cyborg.
